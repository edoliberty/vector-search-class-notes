## Overview
Long Term Memory is a foundational capability in the modern AI Stack. At their core, these systems use vector search. Vector search is also a basic tool for systems that manipulate large collections of media like search engines, knowledge bases, content moderation tools, recommendation systems, etc. As such, the discipline lays at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Database Management Systems. This course will cover the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of vector search applications, algorithms, and systems. The course will be evaluated with project and in-class presentation.

## Project 

Class work includes a final project. It will be graded based on 

1. 50% - Project submission 
1. 50% - In-class presentation 

**Projects can be in three different flavors**

* _Theory/Research_: propose a new algorithm for a problem we explored in class (or modify an existing one), explain what it achieves, give experimental evidence or a proof for its behavior. If you choose this kind of project you are expected to submit a write up.
* _Data Science/AI_: create an interesting use case for vector search using Pinecone, explain what data you used, what value your application brings, and what insights you gained. If you choose this kind of project you are expected to submit code (e.g. Jupyter Notebooks) and a writeup of your results and insights. 
* _Engineering/HPC_: adapt or add to FAISS, explain your improvements, show experimental results. If you choose this kind of project you are expected to submit a branch of FAISS for review along with a short writeup of your suggested improvement and experiments. 


**Project schedule**  

* 11/24 - One-page project proposal approved by the instructors
* 12/1 - Final project submission
* 12/1 - In-class presentation


**Some more details**

* Project Instructor: Nataly <nbrukhim@princeton.edu>
* Projects can be worked on individually, in teams of two or at most three students.
* Expect to spend a few hours over the semester on the project proposal. Try to get it approved well ahead of the deadline. 
* Expect to spent 3-5 _full days_ on the project itself (on par with preparing for a final exam) 
* In class project project presentation are 5 minutes _per student_ (teams of two students present for 10 minutes. Teams of three, 15 minutes).
